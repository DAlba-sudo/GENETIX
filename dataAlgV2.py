# This will observe the data found in a population
# 
# Functions include:
# - Create Linear Regression algorithms to control bias of each type of gene
#    * Steps needed to achieve this:
#         - Before creating a linear regression algorithm we first need data
#                  - When creating an individual we need to "rebuild" the LR model
